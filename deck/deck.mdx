</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Separation of concerns
  • Content is created and managed independently to our application detail
  • 

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  # We can build sites differently now, too

  Significant improvements to developer tooling

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

  * Serverless by default
  * CDNs - global, secure and fast

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • JAMstack approach abstracts away the maintenance, upkeep of serverless
  • Our applications are securely available across the globe

  # You don't need a commerce *platform*

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Utilise best-of-breed services
  • No 'jack of all trades' approach
  • Best of all, this approach allows you to incrementally transition away from existing systems

</Notes>

 <img src={printful} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Popular drop shipping service
  • Used recently on personal project
  • Offers REST API

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  <img src={json} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Printful API is pretty basic
  • Available fields relate to the product generated in Printful
  • But lacking common meta fields (description, slug, SKU)
  • No scope to extend the model either

</Notes>

<Layout>

  # Filling the gaps

  Bringing other services to the party 🎉

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • We can implement additional APIs or services to enhance our product offering
  • Fulfilling the best-of-breed service approach

  # Orchestrating the content mesh

  With GraphQL and Gatsby

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Gatsby is a compiler for React
  • GraphQL at the core
  • Amazing developer experience
  • NOT only for static sites, can be used to build dynamic experiences too
  • Perfect tool to use when building commerce websites
  • Powerful APIs allow us to source content and build custom GraphQL schema

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  <img src={createNode} style={{ width: '45%'}} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Two options when using GraphQL in Gatsby: native GraphQL APIs, source plugins
  • Extensive APIs for sourcing data in Gatsby
  • Here we're creating Gatsby nodes with our product data from the Printful REST API
  • These nodes can then be queried via GraphQL in our React components for Gatsby

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  <img src={createFile} style={{ width: '75%'}} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • We can also download and create nodes for remote images using `createRemoteFileNode`
  • This allows us to use `gatsby-image` to load product images progressively

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  <img src={gatsbyQuery} style={{ width: '35%'}} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • This query is from the schema automatically generated for us by the Gatsby source plugin
  • We can query nodes that are fetched from third-party sources during build using GraphQL queries
  • This data can then be rendered statically in our React components

  # Extending our product schema

  Using GraphCMS

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • 

</Notes>

<Layout>

  <img src={graphcmsModel} style={{width: '80%'}}/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • We've created a new model in our GraphCMS project
  • `printfulProductId` field ties our GraphCMS content directly to the associated Printful product
  • This relationship is unfortunately

  # Dynamic product data

  Fetching data on page load with Apollo Client

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Gatsby runs data queries at build time, resulting in static page builds
  • We can utilise other GraphQL clients, such as Apollo, to fetch non-static data during page load
  • Inventory, product reviews are examples of this

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

  <img src={apolloQuery} style={{ width: '35%' }}/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

  • Sideloading data dynamically like this ensure we get the most recent records
  • Prevents blocking rendering of essential page
  • Maintains perception of page speed
